# ðŸ“Š Univariate Analysis - Wii Games Sales Data Project


This project is a part of my BDAT1005 course's Individual Take-home Learning Test on Univariate Analysis, focusing on exploring, organizing, and analyzing a dataset for Wii game sales and ratings. The dataset includes eleven Wii games with details such as sales by region, release year, developer, ratings, and user counts. Iâ€™ve also added a custom game entry for my analysis.

Project Overview
The assignment objectives are to:

### Organize the Dataset: **Duplicate and arrange data in a new worksheet, separating independent and dependent variables.**

Analyze Sales Data: Calculate global sales, provide interpretations, and visualize user counts through a pie chart.

Pareto Analysis: Generate a Pareto chart to assess the global sales ranking of each game.

Create Pivot Tables & Charts: Use pivot tables and charts to display global sales by genre.

Descriptive Statistics: Generate and interpret descriptive statistics for the sales data variables.

Box Plot Analysis: Create a box plot of global sales, identifying potential outliers using the 1.5*IQR rule.

## Key Deliverables

Arranged Dataset: Reorganized data with custom game entry
Charts and Visualizations: Including pie charts, Pareto charts, pivot tables, and box plots
Descriptive Statistics: Summary of each sales metric with confidence level
